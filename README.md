# Artisanal Mining Sites in the Runde Rural District, Zimbabwe

The Zimbabwe Environmental Law Association (ZELA) conducted a pilot study about Artisanal and Small-Scale Mining (ASM) sites in the Runde Rural District (RRD). A total of 317 sites were visited in February 2019, and questionnaires were completed at each site.

The aim of this study is to provide information to government, the Runde Rural District Council (RRDC) and Environmental Management Agency (EMA) on the profile, nature, ownership, operations and impacts of artisanal and small-scale gold mining in the district. In addition, this webmap will also assist the RRDC in the collection of taxes and levies from the ASM sector as part of efforts to promote domestic resource mobilisation.

Webmap made with support of the International Peace Information Service (IPIS).

## Getting started

To read up on making webmaps using Mapbox GL, take a look at the [documentation](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/simple-map/).

To edit this webmap, open the `index.html`, `map.js` and `style.css` files in a text editor.

To view this webmap, start a local http server (for example at this directory and on port 8080) and open the `index.html` file in you browser on the corresponding port via `localhost:8080/index.html`

Using a local http server for the first time? If you're familiar with NodeJS, we can recommend [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), but there are other options out there aswel, including MAMP, WAMP and XAMPP.

Happy mapping!
